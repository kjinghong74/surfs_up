***Weather Temperature Analysis for June and December in Oahu ***

## **Overview of Project**
  As we know the bussiness of surf and ice cream shop will be influenced by weather, in order to determine whether the bussiness of surf and ice cream shop can be sustainable during the whole year, the observed temperature data for June and December in Oahu was analyzed to represent the temperature conditions in summer and in winter over there.

## **Results**
- The temperature observation count for Jun and Dec is similar, 1700 count for Jun and 1517 count for Dec
- The mean temperature for Jun is 75 degree, 4 degree higher than the mean temperature in Dec (71 degree)
- The minimum temperature for Jun is 64 degree, 8 degree higher than the mean temperature in Dec (56 degree)
- The maximum temperature for Jun is 85 degree, only 2 degree higher than the mean temperature in Dec (83 degree)
- The std for Jun and Dec is similar too, 3.3 for June and 3.7 for Dec

## **Summary**
  The temperature in Dec in Oahu is only a few degree lower compared to the temperature in Jun. Therefore, there is not too much temperature difference in Oahu even between summer season and winter season. So, the temperature is quite sustainable year-round. That is good for opening surf and ice cream shop. But there are other parameters heavely affect the cosumers' habit for surfing and ice cream too, such as the precipitation level and geography location. We should also include two other queries for data analysis. (1) the precipitation level in Jun and Dec; (2) whether temperature and precipitaition level differ at locations, which can be analyzed bases on the parameters for latitude, longitude and elevation.
